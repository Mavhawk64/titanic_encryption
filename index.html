        <h1>The Mysterious Message of the Titans</h1>
        <p>Welcome, Titans, to a festive challenge that will test your skills and bring holiday cheer!</p>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>In the heart of the digital realm, there lies a secret message, encrypted and hidden within a series of
            cryptic texts. These texts have been discovered by the Titans, a legendary team of codebreakers and software
            engineers. The message, believed to be of great importance, is encoded in a way that only the sharpest minds
            can decipher.</p>

        <h2>The Challenge</h2>
        <p>The Titans have stumbled upon a file named
            <code><a href="Titanic_Encryption.txt">Titanic_Encryption.txt</a></code>. This file contains numerous
            lines of text, each a jumble of numbers and random characters. The key to unlocking the message lies in
            extracting the hidden numbers and piecing them together.
        </p>

        <h2>Your Mission</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Extract the Hidden Numbers:</strong>
                <p>Each line in <code><a href="Titanic_Encryption.txt">Titanic_Encryption.txt</a></code> is a mix of
                    random characters interspersed with
                    numbers. Your task is to write a program that reads each line and extracts all the numbers,
                    discarding any non-numeric characters.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Summation of Secrets:</strong>
                <p>Once you have all the numbers from each line, add them together to form one colossal decimal number.
                    This number holds the key to the next phase of decryption.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Binary Translation:</strong>
                <p>Convert the colossal decimal number into an 8-bit-padded binary sequence. Remember, each byte in this
                    binary sequence should be separated by a space for clarity.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>The Final Decryption:</strong>
                <p>Translate the binary sequence into ASCII characters. This will reveal the hidden message that has
                    been waiting for the Titans.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Example</h2>
        <p>Consider the following line from a sample file:</p>
        <p><code>8%M0475873&30s7;4-4^J^0t6245dgnlEr783Z/q612d935U50!25]2uP6j52FrN2@N$@785+y9]5I"?j98U=708n55jb0p7J8b2</code>
        </p>
        <p>Your program should extract the numbers and then sum them with numbers from other lines to eventually reveal
            the hidden ASCII message.</p>
        <p>For example, the above line contains the following numbers:</p>
        <p><code>8047587330744062457836129355025265227859598708550782</code></p>

        <h2>The Reward</h2>
        <p>Unwrapping the message will not only demonstrate your prowess as a Titan but also bring to light a secret
            that
            has been hidden in the digital depths. Are you ready to embark on this quest and unveil the mysteries that
            await?</p>
