**The Mysterious Message of the Titans**

**Background:**
In the heart of the digital realm, there lies a secret message, encrypted and hidden within a series of cryptic texts. These texts have been discovered by the Titans, a legendary team of codebreakers and software engineers. The message, believed to be of great importance, is encoded in a way that only the sharpest minds can decipher.

**The Challenge:**
The Titans have stumbled upon a file named `Titanic_Encryption.txt`. This file contains numerous lines of text, each a jumble of numbers and random characters. The key to unlocking the message lies in extracting the hidden numbers and piecing them together.

**Your Mission:**
1. **Extract the Hidden Numbers:**
   - Each line in `Titanic_Encryption.txt` is a mix of random characters interspersed with numbers.
   - Your task is to write a program that reads each line and extracts all the numbers, discarding any non-numeric characters.

2. **Summation of Secrets:**
   - Once you have all the numbers from each line, add them together to form one colossal decimal number.
   - This number holds the key to the next phase of decryption.

3. **Binary Translation:**
   - Convert the colossal decimal number into an 8-bit-padded binary sequence.
   - Remember, each byte in this binary sequence should be separated by a space for clarity.

4. **The Final Decryption:**
   - Translate the binary sequence into ASCII characters.
   - This will reveal the hidden message that has been waiting for the Titans.

**Example:**
Consider the following line from the file:
`8%M0475873&30s7;4-4^J^0t6245dgnlEr783Z/q612d935U50!25]2uP6j52FrN2@N$@785+y9]5I"?j98U=708n55jb0p7J8b2`

Your program should extract the numbers and then sum them with numbers from other lines to eventually reveal the hidden ASCII message.

**The Reward:**
Unwrapping the message will not only demonstrate your prowess as a Titan but also bring to light a secret that has been hidden in the digital depths. Are you ready to embark on this quest and unveil the mysteries that await?
